Cologne-based company Cognotekt ñ that automates business processes using artificial intelligence ñ making countless jobs in insurance redundant ñ shows how realistic the risk already is for desk workers. At the moment, the German insurance industry employs tens of thousands of handlers to carry out investigations into whether there is an attempted fraud or whether the insurance might be able to reduce the claim sum. ìIn ten years, no more than 20 percent of these employees will still be neededî, predicts Cognotekt managing director Jobst Landgrebe.</description>

The insurance industry is in relentless digital turmoil. Which is almost no difference to other industries. But, it is being hit harder for two reasons: due to the strict regulation of products and companies, there have been market entry barriers, through which technical innovations have long been unable to penetrate the conservative industries. In addition, the linguistic and graphical contents, which insurers deal with, are very complex. As a result, it was more difficult to automate them than in logistics or online trading, where only numbers have to be processed.</description>

If Jobst Landgrebe had his way, insurers would have to be much faster. The founder and owner of Cognotekt relies on artificial intelligence as a provider of efficiency. For years, the businessman worked in the insurance industry and recognised that many claims are so similar that they could be automated successfully. He has built a robot for a service provider in the car insurance business, which examines cost estimates or invoices from workshops to see if they are objectionable.</description>

Artificial intelligence is also a subject being discussed by German insurers. The management consultancy EY Innovalue has just completed a study about how there is still a major discrepancy between perceived opportunities and the actual willingness to change. Accordingly, 75†percent of companies questioned considered automated claims investigation, automated cover verification after simple claims and automated auditing of reports and invoices to be a relevant topic for the future. Up to now, the discussion of these topics within companies has been controversial.</description>

The first suppliers are already tweaking appropriate technology using artificial intelligence. Cognotekt from Cologne has developed software which is based on a learning, stochastic algorithm. Founder Jobst Landgrebe gives an example: a patient wants to draw a benefit from a sick pay insurance policy. The intelligent computer analyses large quantities of data, for example the medical history, and checks how probable it is that the policyholder is actually ill. For unsuspicious cases, it triggers the payment.</description>
