The insurance industry is in an unstoppable digital upheaval. This is hardly different from other sectors. But for two reasons, it is harsher: through the sharp regulation of products and companies there were market entry barriers, through which technical innovations for a long time did not penetrate the conservative branches. In addition, the linguistic and pictorial content with which insurers are concerned are very complex. This made it more difficult to automate them than in logistics or online commerce, where only numbers need to be processed.
Jobst Landgrebe has some prerequisites to accelerate this development. Once he was a medical doctor and mathematician in the insurance industry, then he joined the company's advisory services. For almost two decades, he has dealt with the topic of artificial intelligence. In 2013, he founded the company Cognotekt in Cologne. Its goal is to make simple processes in the health care system or in car insurance by means of machines. (...)

In addition to mathematics, linguistics is a relevant science to program automata. For language is the most important bearer of information, which must be interpreted. When vending machines are analyzed by physicians or letters from workshops, there is a risk of misunderstandings. By structuring language, it is made manageable. The American linguist Noam Chomsky has shown that a context-free (generative) grammar helps to form sentences with meaning from simple elements. Vending machines could not analyze the use of language (pragmatics), but the written semantics would be disclosed. This made Cognotekt machines different from IBM Watson's widely used machine.
"I have invested the entire amount of cover in recent years in linguistic research," says Landgrebe. In addition to 33 permanent employees, his company employs twelve freelancers - many of whom are linguists. "I believe that artificial intelligence can be used in many areas," he says.
