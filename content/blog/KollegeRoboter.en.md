 The Cologne-based company Cognotekt, which automates business processes with the help of artificial intelligence, shows how realistic the danger to desk workers is, and thus eliminates numerous jobs in insurance.
  The German insurance industry today employs tens of thousands of clerks to investigate whether an attempt at fraud is in progress or whether the insurance company can potentially reduce the damage. "In ten years, a maximum of 20 percent of these employees are needed," says Cognotekt CEO Jobst Landgrebe. "Machines can filter out the cases with a precision of 99.9 percent, which should be looked at more closely."
  Just like the job of the cockroach workers, many activities, which are repeated and basically consist only of the processing of data, will be done by machines. "What can be structured well is done by computers over the next ten to fifteen years," the scientist predicts. Things remain with complex decisions. "The ability that makes man really is not replaceable," Landgrebe expects. In addition, however, new jobs are also created, because the data that machines need for their work have to be structured by people.
